 * Original source:

 *
 * Chain one or more middleware functions together.
 * - We pass an array of MiddlewareFactory functions.
 * - We get the current middleware factory using the index.
 * If it exists, first we get the next middleware by using recursion.
 * This would go on until the last middleware factory.
 * - If there is no middleware factory, we just return a middleware function that returns NextResponse.next()
